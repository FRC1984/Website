							<h6>Our 2017 robot, <a class="inlinelink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydomonas" target="blank">Chlamydomonas</a>, shoots balls, picks up gears, and climbs a rope.

                        <p>This is the prototype of the feeder and shooter. Surgical tubing on PVC rollers feed the balls into a high speed shooter. In the prototyping phase, we only had one of each type of wheel, and decided on the best type before adding more.</p>

                        <p>This is the prototype of the intake, hopper, feeder, and shooter. The rollers roll the balls up a small slope into the hopper, where they roll down a slope into the feeder. Here you can also see a prototype of our octocanum drive train, which we did not use on the final robot.</p>

                        <p>Once we had finished prototyping everything, we designed, cut, and welded our final aluminum frame.</p>
