The day camp combines LEGO building, computer programming, design, team-work, and problem-solving skills in a fun and challenging environment.  The day camp is specifically designed for younger students that are interested in exploring robotics using the Lego NXT systems from Lego Education.<br>
 <br>
This camp gives kids in 4th and 5th grade the opportunity to explore engineering, math and science. The process of creating autonomous machines that complete useful tasks is what makes LEGO robotics so much fun!<br>
 <br>
Our Shawnee Mission South high school robotics team (with adult mentor) will guide students as they build and test their LEGO robots and learn valuable engineering principles along the way.  Students will work in teams.<br>
 <br>
This camp will meet for 6 hours will be limited to 14 students (2:1 student to teacher ratio). This camp will be a key fundraiser for the Shawnee Mission South Robotics team for the 2018 season.<br>
 <br>
